# Problem Statement & Scope

## Problem Statement
Many university students struggle to track their academic performance across different semesters. While college portals show raw grades, they do not provide visual insights, growth trends, or the ability to compare performance with the class average. Students need a simple, offline tool to analyze their marks and predict future GPA based on their current trajectory.

## Scope
ClassTrack is a desktop-based Python application that:
- Allows students to log and manage their semester-wise marks.
- Calculates SGPA and CGPA automatically based on credits.
- Provides visual analytics (Line charts and Bar graphs) for self-assessment.
- Enables peer-to-peer comparison to encourage healthy competition.

## Target Users
- *University Students:* Specifically those in credit-based systems (like Engineering).
- *Academic Mentors:* To monitor the progress of their mentees.

## High-Level Features
- *Authentication:* Simple Login via Student ID.
- *Data Management:* Add/Update subject marks.
- *Analytics:* Weighted GPA calculation and Trend Analysis.
- *Visualization:* Graphical representation of growth using Matplotlib.
- *Prediction:* Basic algorithm to predict next semester's GPA.
